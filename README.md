# Linked Lists And Polynomials C++

In this assignment I created a linked list from scratch to work with the professorâ€™s polynomials class. The poly class was also missing a lot of functionality witch I had to add.  

## What I learned
- I learned about linked lists and data structures
- Wrote all the main utility functions of a list for my linked list
